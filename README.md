sparrow-py
==========

Sparrow-py is a lightweight Python web-framework sample. It demonstrates how to implement some common web techniques. These techniques include MVC, RUI Routing, HTTP Request Handle, CRUD and Template.

I used couple of libraries to build this sample.

	1. webapp2 - A lightweight Python web framework. Implements the features of RUI Routing, HTTP Request Handle.

	2. Jinja2 - It is a templating language. It handles the View feature of MVC.

	3. Google App Engine - Implements the CRUD feature.
